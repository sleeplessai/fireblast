**Fireblast** is an efficient nuker and disabler skill mastered by funny and happy hero Orge Magi in Dota2. Using ability Fireblast with Multicast can luckily ~surprise~ slam emnemy heros in a sudden, especially when they confront a match that is too close to call. This summer, We bring Fireblast advantages and enjoyment to a software system that implements the Fine-Grained Image Classification algorithms.

**Unrefined Fireblast** requires Aghanim's Scepter to be unlocked. For this, we use **unrefined** as the name of development and untested branch.
